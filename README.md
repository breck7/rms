Thanks for being interested in reality and truth!

I am not accepting signatures, but I would love PRs that add 3 types of things:

1. Better writing/editing. My writing could ALWAYS be shorter and better.

2. More rows of data on the great organizations around the world using the work of RMS (there are
   an insane #).

3. Links to **new** organizations that are carrying the torch to #LiberateIdeas. We have
   a long way to go and FSF will not get us there. We need 100 new organizations. We need
   to look beyond licenses. We need to acknowledge that the #ImaginaryProperty system is
   a lie, that oppresses ideas and the people. Please start something new and add it to this list.
